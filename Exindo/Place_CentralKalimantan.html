                    <h3>Palangkaraya</h3>                
                    <p>Central Kalimantan, dominated by the indigenous Dayaks, is known as the lung of the world for its vast and fertile tropical jungles and forests. The northern mountain chain, the Schwaner Range, is home to some of the most pristine forests in Kalimantan. Certain areas are within WWF’s Heart of Borneo conservation initiative signed by the 3 nations, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. </p>
                    <p>These mountains are the source of 11 mighty rivers intersecting the vast lowland peat swamps and finishing their journey in dense, crocodile infested mangroves along the estuaries of Central Kalimantan. Peat swamps are home to iconic Bornean fauna, the orangutan, the proboscis monkey and red leaf eating monkey and many bird species. Deer, clouded leopards, porcupines, sun bears, giant pythons, magnificent hornbills, monitor lizards and wild civet cats also share this jungle habitat.</p>
                    <p>Palangkaraya, or Honoured and Sacred Great Place, is the capital city. Growing from Pahandut, a small stilt village on the banks of the Kahayan River, the first President of Indonesia, Sukarno, had decided that that it would become the next site of Indonesia’s capital. The new city was completely designed from scratch and built in grand proportions in the 1960’s. </p>
                    <p>Palangkaraya has it own eco tourism pioneers in Kalimantan Tour Destinations, who have introduced a comfortably remodeled traditional ‘rangkan’ river boat. Cruises encompass the natural beauty and magnificent fauna, particularly the orangutan, of Borneo. Working with local communities to create a true ecotourism experience, one guest rated it as an iconic Indonesian experience, and went on the say:</p>
                    <p>The Rahai’i Pangun Jungle River Boat journeys offer minimal impact viewing of its rainforest, wildlife, especially orangutans, and riverside Dayak villages from the vantage point of a traditional river mode of transportation. It also benefits local communities by generating alternative livelihoods and teaching new skills that contribute to the development of a sustainable local eco-tourism economy.</p>
                    <p>About 700km southwest of Palangkaraya lies the town of Pangkalan Bun which is an entrance to the Tanjung Puting National Park. Tanjung Puting National Park has long been a centre for orangutan research and rehabilitation. Founded by noted orangutan expert and former Richard Leakey student, Birute Galdikas, arrangements for cruising canals in the Park, and disembarking to walk through forests to orangutan feeding stations are beautifully established and maintained. Rehabilitated orangutans are free at the stations and jetties. Many tour companies operate cruises on local boats with simple sleeping arrangements, or use the Rimba Eco Lodge on the park boundary. For 3 or 4 days, enjoy the natural beauty of this park, and come face to face with the orangutan.</p>

                    <h3>Sebangau National Park</h3>
                    <p>Spread out between the Katingan and the Sebangau Rivers, just at the outskirt of Palangkaraya, the Sebangau National Park in Central Kalimantan is one of the last remaining peat swamp forests in Borneo. The vast national park covering approximately 568,700-hectare is home to over 6,000 orangutans, forming one of the world’s largest populations in the wild. Aside from its rich biodiversity, the forest is also known for its special ecosystem:  that of the black water ecosystem. This particular ecosystem was created from decomposing organic matter living in these peat swamps, resulting in the blackened water and the unique variety of organisms.</p>
                    <p>The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Indonesia campaigned to establish the park, which was gazetted in 2004, and the organizaton remains at the forefront at involving nearby residents in low-impact logging, home industry, reforestation and ecotourism. Thus, providing balance harmony between the preservation of Orangutan and the community. </p>
                    <p>Latest developments based on genetic research by Zhang (2001) and Taxonomy by Groves (1999) revealed that the Borneo Orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, is of a different species from the Sumatran Pongo abelli. The Borneo orangutan has a distinctive body shape with very long arms that may reach up to two meters in length. They have a coarse, shaggy reddish coat and grasping hands and feet. They are highly sexually dimorphic, with adult males being distinguished by their large size, throat pouch and flanges on either side of the face, known as cheek pads. The Borneo orangutan travels on the ground more than its Sumatran counterpart. It is theorized this may be partly because herethere is no need to avoid large predators as found in Sumatra including he Sumatran Tigers.</p>
                    <p>Aside from being the home of huge communities of orangutans, the park is also habitat to 35 species of mammals, 116 species of Borneo typical birds, 36 species of fish, and about 166 species of flora. Some of the particular animals that roam freely in these forests include: orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), Southern pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), kelasi (Presbytis rubicunda), proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) , Sun Bears (Helarctos malayanus), Forest cats (Felis bangalensis), Chipmunks (Exilisciurus axilis), hornbills or  enggang gunung (A. undulatus), enggang gading (Buceros vigil), enggang badak (Buceros rhinoceros), Swamp Heron (Ciconia stormi), pecuk ular (Anhinga melanogaster), cangak merah (Ardea purpurea), cangak laut (Ardea sumatrana), Black Eagle (Ictinaetus malayensis), Catfish (Clarias sp.), papuyu (Anabas testudineus), kakapar (Belontia hesselti), andsambaling (Betta sp). Among some of the flora found in the park are:  jelutung (Dyera lowii), belangeran (Shorea belangeran), pulai (Alstonia angustifolia), ulin wood, Deer Horn orchids and black orchids.</p>
                    <p>Amidst the peat swamp forests, the National Park also offers beautiful scenery of pristine hills. From the top of Bukit Batu or Rock Hill, one overlooks the Sebangau National Park and all its fascinating scenery. The hill is also the perfect spot for bird watching since white Herons, swallows, Green Cucaks, Keruang, Kepodang, and Bald Eagles are among some of the exotic birds that nest here on the hills. A long and challenging trek is available at Bukit Bulan or the Moon Hill. As trekkers make their way up the hill, they will be presented with refreshing trails along the Sungai Bulan, or Moon River. A unique ecosystem of peat swamp and granite rocks is observable at Bukit Kaki or Foot Hill. The granite rockz cause a dry environment, and thus the trees are different from those in the surrounding environment.</p>
                    <p>In the Sebangau National park are also crystal clear, refreshing, fresh water lakes. These lakes are also habitat to various species of fish and other distinct flora and fauna, and are the best place to watch nature‘s process at its finest. These magnificent lakes are known as Bulat Lake (Round Lake),  Punggualas Lake, Jalan Pangen Lake, and Panjang Lake (Long Lake).</p>

                    <h3>Tanjung Puting National Park</h3>
                    <p>Imagine you are an explorer heading out to the jungle to see wild orang utans and other exotic tropical animals and you will begin to get a sense of what a visit to theTanjung Puting National Park is like.</p>
                    <p>The park, which covers territory the size of Bali, is home to an amazing array of wildlife including it’s world famous orang utans. The park is also home to monkeys, birds and other wildlife, not to mention the pristine vegetation of the jungle itself. This is a world famous natural treasure which attracts a growing number of international visitors each year.</p>
                    <p>Tanjung Puting is located in Central Kalimantan. The area was originally declared as a game reserve in 1935 and became a national park in 1982. The park sits on a peninsula that juts out into the Java sea. The sheer size of the park means that it has diverse habitat zones. This diversity means the park is home to a great variety of inhabitants, both flora and fauna.</p>
                    <p>The incredible jungle surrounds make this an amazing place to visit if you’re after a truly outdoor adventure. It is an oasis of pure clean air, a clear night sky as well as a home to the gentle people of the jungle – the orang utans.</p>
                    <p>The orang utans are undoubtedly the best known inhabitants of the park, made famous through the work of the Orangutan Research and Conservation Program based at the Camp Leakey research station. Camp Leakey is an orangutan preserve and the site of the longest continuous study of any wild animal in the history of science. With around three quarters of the world’s orang utan’s population living on Borneo, this park is the ideal place to see these incredible creatures in the wild.</p>
                    <p>Because the vegetation of Tanjung Puting supports a large population of animals this park is one of the most important areas in Southeast Asia for the preservation of primates, birds, reptiles and fish. To reach the Tanjung Puting National Park take a flight to the Iskandar Airport at Pangkalan Bun from Jakarta or other main Indonesian cities.</p>
