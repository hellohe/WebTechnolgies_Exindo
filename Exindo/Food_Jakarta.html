                  <p>Ketoprak Jakarta consists of lontong (rice steamed in a banana leaf), tofu, sliced cabbage, mihun (thin rice noodles), sprouts, chips and a sauce made from ground peanut and palm sugar made into a thick paste, mixed with chilli, salt, garlic and also sweet soybean ketchup. It is sold in individual portions from small stalls or carts along the street. Customers may request that the dish be mild, medium or spicy. The price is about IDR 5.000 to 10.000 according to ingredients included.</p>
				  <p>Ketoprak is a typical street-food/dish. It was originally popular around the Jakarta area but has spread throughout Java. It is nearly similar to Lotek and Karedok from West Java, Gado-gado from Jakarta and also Pecel from Central Java, although the ingredients in the peanut sauces are different. Gado-gado and Karedok use only brown sugar for sweetening, but sweet soy sauce is used for additional sweetener in ketoprak, and garlic is added. The seller prepares the ingredients at home and mixes them in front of the customers as they place their orders.</p>

                  <p>Kerak telor (English: Egg crust) is a Betawi traditional spicy omelette dish in Indonesian cuisine. It is made from glutinous rice cooked with egg and served with serundeng (fried shredded coconut), fried shallots and dried shrimp as topping.[1] It is considered as a snack and not as a main dish. The vendors of kerak telor are easily the most ubiquitous during annual Jakarta Fair and it has also become a must-have menu item for visitors at the event.</p>

                    <p>Gado-gado (Indonesian or Betawi), also known as lotek (Sundanese and Javanese), is an Indonesian salad of slightly boiled vegetables and hard-boiled eggs served with a peanut sauce dressing.</p>
                    <p>Gado-gado in Indonesian literary means "mix-mix" since it is made of rich mixture of vegetables such as potatoes, string beans, bean sprouts, spinach, chayote, bitter gourd, corn and cabbage, with tofu, tempeh and hard-boiled eggs, all mixed in peanut sauce dressing, sometimes also topped with krupuk and sprinkles of fried shallots. Gado-gado is different from lotek atah or karedok which uses raw vegetables. Another similar dish is the Javanese pecel.</p>
                    <p>Formerly, gado-gado sauce was generally made to order, sometimes in front of the customers to suit their personal preference for the amount of chili pepper included. However, particularly in the West, gado-gado sauce is often prepared ahead of time and in bulk, Gado-gado sauce is also available in dried form, which simply needs to be rehydrated by adding hot water. Gado-gado sauce is not to be confused with satay sauce, which is also a peanut sauce.</p>

Nasi uduk is made by cooking rice soaked in coconut milk instead of water, along with clove, cassia bark, and lemongrass to add aroma. Sometimes knotted pandan leaves are thrown into the rice while steaming to give it more fragrance. The coconut milk and spices gave oily rich tastes to the cooked rice. The bawang goreng (fried shallots) sprinkled on the top of the rice prior to serving. Assortments of dishes are usually served as side dishes. The pre-packed nasi uduk usually wrapped inside banana leaf. Nasi uduk sold in warung or other eating establishments are commonly offered with assortment of side dishes, chosen according to client's desire.
