                  <p>Nasi liwet is a kind of food from Solo, Central Java. Rice is usually cooked in water, but nasi liwet is rice cooked in coconut milk andchicken broth, thus giving the rice a rich and succulent taste. This is a traditional Javanese way of cooking, from the past until now. In the past, the pan used for cooking was made of clay. The taste is generally better if it is cooked on a wood fire, but different regions have different ways of preparing it. Nasi liwet is usually served together with opor ayam (chicken in a mild white coconut milk based sauce), telur pindang (eggs boiled slowly with spices), and labu siam (chayote/choko) as the vegetable. </p>
				  <p>Traditionally, it is served on a banana leaf or teakwood leaf. Frequently, people prefer teakwood leaves to plates, because of the fragrance of the leaf. It is believed that the fragrance will increase one's appetite. Nasi liwet complements (side dishes) always consist of coconut milk.</p>
                  <p>In Solo, it is usually eaten for breakfast, but also for lunch. In Keprabon district, nasi liwet is only served at nighttime.</p>

                    <p>Wingko, which is sometimes called Wingko Babat, is a traditional Javanese pancake-like snack made from coconut.</p>
                    <p>It is a kind of cake made mainly of coconut and other ingredients. Wingko is popular especially along the north coast of Java island. It is sold mostly by peddlers on trains, at bus or train stations, or in the producer's own shop. This might explain why it's very popular in Java to use wingko as a gift to families upon returning from traveling.</p>
                    <p>Wingko is typically a round, almost hard coconut cake that is typically served in warm, small pieces. Wingko is sold either in the form of a large, plate-sized cake or small, paper wrapped cakes. It's delicious due to the combined sweetness of sugar and the unique, fresh taste of crispy coconut. The price varies, depending on where it's sold. The more famous the brand of cake, the more expensive the cake. Your bargaining skills might lower the price a little.</p>

                  <p>Selat solo (Javanese for: "Solo salad") is a western-derived Javanese cuisine specialty of Solo city, Central Java, Indonesia. It consists of braised beef tenderloin served in thin watery sauce made from a mixture of garlic, vinegar, kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), Worcestershire sauce, water, and spiced with nutmeg and black pepper. It is served with hard boiled egg and vegetables such as string beans, potato, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, cauliflower or broccoli and carrot, and topped with potato chips and some dash of mustard or mayonaise on the side.</p>
                  <p>Despite its Javanese name — Selat Solo — that denote "salad", its centerpiece is the chunk of beef (preferably tenderloin) that makes this dish hardly a salad, it is more likely to be categorized as a type of braised beef steak in Javanese mildly sweet watery sauce. Some might describe this dish as the cross-over between beefsteak, salad and soup.[1] This dish sometimes also called asBistik Jawa (Javanese beefsteak), although Javanese beefsteak could refer to another similar dish with less watery sauce.</p>

                  <p>Serabi, surabi or called srabi is an Indonesian pancake that is made from rice flour with coconut milk or just plain shredded coconutas an emulsifier. Most of traditional serabi tastes sweet, as the pancake usually eaten with kinca or thick golden-brownish coloredcoconut sugar syrup. However another savoury version also existed that uses oncom toppings. Each province in Indonesia has various serabi recipes corresponding to local tastes.</p>
                  <p>The origin of serabi is obscure, however it is thought that the name serabi derived from "Serbia" as it came from the originator of the recipe who was at the time trying to recreate palačinke, an originally Serbian pancake. It was probably progenited during Dutch East Indies era where the immigrants from Serbia came to the Indies and left their marks in local culinary. Yet the rice flour—coconut milk based kue (delicacies) are already developed earlier in Indonesia.</p>
