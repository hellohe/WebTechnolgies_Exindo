Nasi liwet is usually served together with opor ayam (chicken in a mild white coconut milk based sauce), telur pindang (eggs boiled slowly with spices), and labu siam (chayote/choko) as the vegetable. </p>
				  <p>Traditionally, it is served on a banana leaf or teakwood leaf. Frequently, people prefer teakwood leaves to plates, because of the fragrance of the leaf. It is believed that the fragrance will increase one's appetite. Nasi liwet complements (side dishes) always consist of coconut milk.</p>
                  <p>In Solo, it is usually eaten for breakfast, but also for lunch. In Keprabon district, nasi liwet is only served at nighttime.</p>

The price varies, depending on where it's sold. The more famous the brand of cake, the more expensive the cake. Your bargaining skills might lower the price a little.</p>
