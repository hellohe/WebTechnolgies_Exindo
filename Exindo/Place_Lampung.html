The enticing white sand refreshes the eyes and feeds the soul with the burning energy to explore. Only 20 kilometers away from Bandar Lampung, this spot has gained more and more popularity these days.</p>

                <h3>Bukit Barisan National Park</h3>
                <p>Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) – or the South Bukit Barisan National Park - spans over three of Sumatra’s provinces. They are: Lampung, South Sumatra and Bengkulu. Along with Mount Leuser and Kerinci Seblat, the combined national parks make up the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra inscribed in the UNESCO’s World Heritage List, which runs along the entire western spine of the island.  The main objective of the national park is to protect the existence of Sumatra’s tropical rainforests along with all their biodiversity. Sumatran Elephants (Elephas maximus sumatranus), Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) and Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) are among some of the rare and exotic fauna found in the area.</p>
                <p>Starting as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1935, the area became a National Park in 1982. Initially, South Bukit Barisan Park covered a total area of 356,800 hectares, but recent measurements using GIS recorded that the latest total area is in fact 324,000 hectares.  The park is located at the southwestly end of Sumatra.  Seventy percent of the park lies within the administrative areas of West Lampungand Tanggamus in the Lampung Province, while 74,822 hectares (about 23%) is located within the boundaries of Kaur district, in the province of Bengkulu.While the remainder of the park lies within the province of South Sumatra.</p>
                <p>The South Bukit Barisan Park is included in the Global 200 Ecoregions, WWF's ranking of the Earth's most biologically outstanding terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. The park is also highlighted as a priority area for the Sumatran rhino conservation through WWF's Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS). In addition, IUCN, WCS and WWF have identified the South Bukit Barisan as "Tiger Conservation Unit I", the most important forest area for the conservation of tigers in the world. Other endemic fauna that also inhabit the area are: honey bears (Helarctos malayanus malayanus), tapirs (Tapirus indicus), ungko (Hylobates agilis), siamang (H. syndactylus syndactylus), simpai (Presbytis melalophos fuscamurina), kancil (Tragulus javanicus kanchil),  and the scaled sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata).</p>
                <p>Aside from  its fauna, the park also presents splendors in leaves and flowers. The exotic Giant Carrion Flowers or Titan Arum  (Amorphophallus titanium) and the Tall Carrion Flowers (Amorphophallus decus-silvae) are among the largest flowers existing on earth. The height of the Amorphophallus decus-silvae has been recorded to reach over 2 meters tall. Generally confused with the Carrion Flowers, the Rafflesia flowers (Rafflesia arnoldii) are also found in certain areas of the park. The Rafflesia flower is noted for producing the largest individual flower on earth, while the Titan Arum and Talipolt Palm are technically clusters of many flowers. The national park is also home of the largest orchid known to the planet, locally popular as “Anggrek Tebu” or Sugarcane Orchid (Grammatophyllum speciosum).</p>
                <p>Other flora in this South Bukit Barisan Park  include: pidada (Sonneratia sp.), nipah (Nypa fruticans), Sea Pines (Casuarina equisetifolia), pandan (Pandanus sp.), cempaka (Michelia champaka), meranti (Shorea sp.), mersawa (Anisoptera curtisii), ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), keruing (Dipterocarpus sp.), damar (Agathis sp.), and rattan (Calamus sp.)</p>

                    <h3>Way Kambas National Park</h3>
                    <p>Located at the southern tip of Sumatra, 110 km from Bandarlampung, the Way Kambas National Park (WKNP) is one of the oldest reserves in Indonesia.  It occupies 1,300 sq km of coastal lowland forest around the Way Kambas River on the east coast of the province of Lampung. WKNP is closely associated with elephants, since aside from being a sanctuary for these gentle giants, the national park is also known as their training ground.
                    <p>Way Kambas was established as a game reserve by the Dutch administration in 1937. Sadly, between 1954 and 1974 it was intensively logged. In 1978, it was proposed as a national park, with provisional declaration in 1989, and final declaration in 1997.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that approximately 200 Sumatran elephants (Elephas maximus sumatranensis) live within the park. The Sumatran elephant is one of three recognized subspecies of the Asian Elephant, and native to Sumatra Island. In general, Asian elephants are smaller than those of Africa and have the highest body point on the head. Among the Asian elephants, the Sumatran elephants are the smallest, with a shoulder height ranging between 2 meters and 3.2 meters (6.6 ft.  to 10.5 ft). Wild Sumatran elephants were formerly found in eight provinces of Sumatra. However, the dense and tangled vegetation of the tropical rainforests there makes it difficult to estimate their exact number.</p>
                    <p>Officially established in 1985, the Elephant Training Center, located 9 km from the park’s Plang Ijo entrance, is an establishment aimed to protect the existence of the elephant and at the same time create mutual benefit for both the elephants and men. The training center is also a reminiscent of the time when kings or sultans ruled Sumatra, when elephants were trained and deployed in warfare and also for ceremonial purposes. Here, visitors can observe elephants perform various tasks such as transporting lumber or plowing fields. They can also perform peculiar activities such as playing football or other entertaining performances.</p>
                    <p>Also operating in the park is the Sumatra Rhino Sanctuary (SRS), where rhinos, formerly held in captivity are introduced to natural surroundings in the hope of successful breeding. The breeding center was established in 1995, and encompasses 100 hectares (247 acres) for propagation, research and education. The five Sumatran rhinos (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis ) living at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary - Rosa, Ratu, Bina, Torgamba, and Andalas - serve as ambassadors for their wild counterparts. They also act as specimens for education for local communities and the general public and play a vital part to ensure the continuous existence of their species.</p>
                    <p>The area around Way Kanan, a sub-district of the park is frequently visited by birdwatchers. Of the most remarkable species are the white-winged ducks and the Storm’s stork.</p>
                    <p>Other mammals that also inhabit the national park include: the Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae), the tapir (Tapirus indicus), the jungle dogs (Cuon alpinus sumatrensis), and the siamang monkeys (Hylobates syndactylus syndactylus). Among the 406 species of birds are: the Jungle ducks (Cairina scutulata), sandang lawe Herons (Ciconia episcopus stormi), tong-tong Herons (Leptoptilos javanicus), blue sempidan (Lophura ignita), kuau (Argusianus argus argus), and pecuk ular (Anhinga melanogaster). There are also numerous reptiles, fish, and insects within the sanctuary of WKNP. </p>
