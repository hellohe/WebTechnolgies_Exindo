                    <h3>Kuta Beach</h3>
                    <p>Once a sleepy village with a quiet, beautiful sweep of beach, Kuta today has become a popular beach destination in its own right, alive with tourists from all over the world, swimming, surfing or sunbathing by the beach. Others, casually dressed in shorts, T-shirts and flip-flops stroll along its main road, shopping around or enjoying meals at its many open air restaurants. When in Kuta you know that you are in a holiday town, and people here are in a holiday mood. </p>
                    <p>Back in the 1960’s the only hotel was the Kuta Beach Hotel, but soon without much planning, Kuta developed rapidly into a haunt for surfers and backpackers, while the high end market preferred to stay at the more sedate Sanur village on the opposite side of the peninsula.  </p> 
                    <p>With time, Kuta’s popularity grew, and shops, restaurants, discos hotels, - from the simple to the exclusive - sprang up along the main road from Kuta to Legian, catering to the ever increasing holiday crowd, that not only included international tourists but also domestic visitors from Jakarta and other big cities. </p>
                    <p>On the beach, people enjoy parasailing, banana boat trips or swimming Women offer traditional Indonesian massage on the beach, others are seen plaiting hair. Before sunset, crowds rush to the beach waiting to watch Kuta’s legendary sunsets. Then as darkness falls, Kuta’s nightlife starts to throb with loud music from bars and restaurants, while shops stay open till late at night. Kuta’s main attraction is that everyone can enjoy the town without any prescribed dress code. </p>
                    <p>Many famous international bands and celebrities have voluntarily played and sung here enlivening the fun, dance and music scene of Kuta. One poignant reminder, however, of the tragedy that befell Kuta is a monument located next to the present Paddy’s café. The monument is erected in memory of those killed during the fatal October 2002 bomb terrorist blasts. The blasts killed more than 300 people, mostly Australian tourists and Indonesian workers.</p>

					<h3>Ubud – Ubud Monkey Forest</h3>
					<p>If you’re looking for peace and quiet, then Ubud is the place to be. Steeped in culture and enhanced by magnificent vistas, Ubud offers a respite from the humdrum of your busy life.

					<h3>Tanah Lot</h3>
					<p>To many people, Tanah Lot epitomizes the romantic island of Bali. This is the image of Balinese temples on the rock facing the wide open ocean, perched high above the crashing waves below, with as background the colorful sky at dusk, lit by the slowly disappearing setting sun.
					<p>Located in the sea some 300 meters from shore, the huge rock of Tanah Lot is reachable overland at low tide. On its northern side stand two Balinese temples built on an overhanging cliff which connects the islet to the shore. Underneath the rock are caves that are inhabited by sea snakes, believed to be the guardians of the temples. </p>    
					<p>The Tanah Lot temples form an inseparable part of the Dang Kahyangan temples, the six most holy temples on Bali, but here believers pray to the god of the sea. On the west side of the rock is a spring which the Hindus believe to be holy water and the reason why the temples were built on this rock. </p>
					<p>Tanah Lot is derived from the words “Tanah” meaning a rock or land, while “Lot” or “Lod” means south or the sea. Therefore Tanah Lot means the Rock by the Sea.  The temples of Tanah Lot were said to have been built in the 16th century by  the  Hindu  priest  Bawu Rawuh, better known as Danghyang Nirartha,  who came from the kingdom of Majapahit in East Java, and travelled to Bali to spread the Hindu religion. Arriving at this spot he was inspired by the sacredness of the place and advised his followers to build the temples at this location. </p> 
					<p>According to legend it was Danghyang Nirartha who successfully strengthened the belief of the local population in the Hindu religion.   However, in the process, another local religious leader named Bendesa Beraban, felt competed since many of his followers turned to Danghyang Nirarta. Seeing this, Bendesa ordered Danghyang Nirartha to leave the area of Tanah Lot.</p>
					<p>Nirartha agreed but before leaving, he gathered all his powers, lifted the rock, and moved this further out to sea, building temples on this rock. He then transformed his shawl into snakes to guard the temples. Upon seeing this, Bendesa Beraban was awed and became a follower of Danghyang Nirartha. Until today the sea snakes still make the caves their habitat. They have a flat tail like a fish and are black in color with yellow stripes. On certain days when the sun sets towards the north one can see the rays shining right onto the caves.</p>

					<h3>The Giant Garuda Wisnu Kencana (GWK) Statue</h3>
					<p>Situated on a limestone plateau in south Bali, high on the Bukit Peninsula, 300 meters above Bali’s shoreline, is the Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park that offers a grand view on Jimbaran Bay and Kuta to the west, and Tanjung Benoa andSanur to the east with the imposing Mount Agung and Mount Batur as its background.</p>
					<p>Focal point of this Cultural Park is the magnificent Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue, that will reach a total height of 126 meters, weighing 3,000 tons, that will be taller than the Statue of Liberty in New York. The statue depicts Lord Vishnu mounting the mythical Garuda bird, as manifestation of the conscience of Amerta, the Perennial Goodness.</p>
					<p>At present, the 23 meters high head and torso of Lord Vishnu already stands in place. Still in construction is the giant Garuda Bird. When completed, both the head and torso of Lord Vishnu will be placed on the Garuda bird, which together will reach 75 meters high with the Garuda wings spanning 64 meters wide. The entire statue will then be placed on top of a 60 meters pedestal, so that the total structure will stand 126 meters high. The statue’s structure is made of copper, brass, steel, with gold mosaic placed on specified parts.</p>
					<p>This incredible monument will then be visible from a 20 Km distance, and can be clearly viewed from Kuta, Sanur, Nusa Dua, Uluwatu and Tanah Lot. Visitors will be able to ascend inside the statue to its chest level. From that height, visitors will look down upon the most panoramic view of the fabled island of Bali.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, work on the statue had stalled 16 years, but will now finally be resumed, which will take three years to complete, said I Nyoman Nuarta, Indonesia’s maestro sculptor and creator of this iconic statue. Having been postponed since 1997, this monument is projected to become an exceptional landmark for Indonesia’s tourism in this modern age.</p>
					<p>Conceptionalized by sculptor I Nyoman Nuarta, actual work on the statue is, nonetheless, not undertaken in Bali, but in the artist’sworkshop, NuArt Studio, in the mountain town of Bandung in West Java, involving many artists and experts from various fields.</p>
					<p>Born in Tabanan, Bali, in 1951, I Nyoman Nuarta is one of the Indonesia’s outstanding pioneers in the new visual art movement since 1976. While still at college, in 1979 Nyoman Nuarta already won Indonesia’s Independence Declarators Statue Competition. Until this day, Nuarta has created over a hundred statues which all reflect modern art in sculpture which follows the naturalistic style. Most of his statues are made of copper and brass.</p>
					<p>At the moment, about 200 workers are working in NuArt Studio in the construction of this magnificent statue. Upon completion, the statue will be sent in parts from Bandung to Bali to be reassembled on the site at the Bukit Peninsula.</p>
					<p>As many as 13 modules of the project are currently being transported, which are expected to reach Bali late July or early August 2013. The process of reassembling will cost around IDR157 billions, even more expensive than the work on the statue itself which took IDR150 billion. It will take about 400 huge trucks to transport parts of the 3,000 tons statue from Bandung to the site in Bali. Modules will be transported in stages over the course of three years.</p>
					<p>The Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue and park was initiated by members of the Garuda Wisnu Kencana Foundation, a group of influential people, that include Joop Ave, then Minister for Tourism and Telecommunications , IB Sudjana, Minister for Mining and Energy, I Made Mangku Pastika,current Governor of Bali, sculptor I Nyoman Nuarta, and a number of businessmen.</p>
